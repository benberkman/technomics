# costverse packages at Technomics, Inc.

While at Technomics, Inc. I co-developed three R packages to import, normalize, and analyze a new Department of Defense cost data format -- the FlexFile. These packages -- readflexfile, ezflexfile, and shinyflexfile -- were part of a larger Technomics initiative called the costverse. The costverse is an open ecosystem of interrelated packages to facilitate cost analysis in R.

This repository hosts the link to the Interational Cost Estimating and Analysis Conference (ICEAA) paper that introduced these packages. The following video links to our virtual presentation of this paper, as well as a demo of these packages: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvP9R172_mc.

The packages and underlying code are hosted on an internal Technomics Gitlab. This repository hosts the paper and conference presentation, both of which demonstrate the packages utility.

The packages and paper were developed while I was employed at Technomics, Inc. Copyright Â© 2020 by Technomics, Inc. All rights reserved.
